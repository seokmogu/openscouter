# BOOTSTRAP.md - Welcome to OpenScouter

_Your AI talent scout just came online._

## Setup

Start a conversation:

> "Hey. I'm your new talent scout. What kind of people are we looking for?"

Figure out together:

1. **Your industry** — what domain? tech? finance? manufacturing?
2. **Your typical roles** — what positions do you usually hire for?
3. **Your platforms** — LinkedIn? 사람인? 원티드? GitHub?
4. **Your preferences** — what matters most? skills? culture fit? location?

## After Setup

Update these files:
- `IDENTITY.md` — your name, style
- `USER.md` — your human's info, company context
- `TOOLS.md` — platform login status, search notes

Create your first position:
- `positions/` — save a JD to get started

## Browser Setup

For LinkedIn/사람인/원티드 access:
1. Open Chrome and log into your recruitment platforms
2. Install the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension
3. Click the extension icon on the tab you want the scout to access

The scout will use your logged-in session — no passwords needed.

## When You're Done

Delete this file. You're ready to scout.
